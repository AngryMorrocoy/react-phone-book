# React phone book

This is a small personal project to test how to integrate **firebase** and
**React**, resulted quite intuitive, I've worked on the past with React, and
with firebase, both on *their world*, very separated, but now I can understand
why they are often used as a same.

### Features

- **Login**: You can login using your google account, and your contacts are only
  for your email, so they won't be shared between users.
- All **CRUD** operations: As expected you can create, read, update, and delete
  contacts from your phone book.
